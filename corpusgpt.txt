Hi, my name is Jacob Rosen, and I just want to say that it is very crazy, that it is the time to culminate out of 5th grade.
It feels like on the very first day of kindergarten, I started out with an empty tool belt.
Every lesson, grade, thing I learned, and test felt like adding a brand new tool into my belt.
I have so many tools in my belt, I could build a bridge.
That bridge will carry me to middle school, and with all of these tools, I am very prepared.
Willow has taught me so much, and I have gone through kindergarten, 5th grade, and every grade in between.
The bridge I am going to build is huge, but Willow gave me the tools to walk across the bridge.
It all began when I first walked into the kindergarten classroom.
So much has changed since that day, academically and not.
I barely knew anything, I didn’t have braces or glasses, and I wasn’t very mature.
I was very lucky, I came to Willow the final year there was a kinder campout, and the last year of reciting the Finding Dracula poem too.
But we are talking about kindergarten, not about how lucky I was.
The kindergarten campout taught me a lot, like how to be brave in situations you have never been in before.
With that tool in my toolkit, I will use it to be brave enough to build that bridge, and cross the gap into middle school.
Starting a new experience, when I went to 1st grade, I got to go to the big yard, with the 2nd graders and the giant 3rd graders, which taught me about kids who were older than me.
What gave me an even better tool was Turkey-Tea.
Turkey-Tea is when the 1st graders go up on stage around Thanksgiving time, and sing some songs.
That was one of the first times I ever went on stage.
When you are that young, it takes a lot of guts to do that.
I guess that gave me a tool of perseverance, which lets me keep building the bridge, even when it is embarrassing, or not going well.
Surprisingly, 2nd grade taught me a very big lesson.
I was in Fersht’s class, and we were reading a book called Strega Nona.
Now I don’t remember much about the book, but what I do remember is that there was a character named Big Anthony.
One thing I remember about Big Anthony is that he went to a magic pot, said a spell to make pasta, said the spell to stop it, but what he did not know was that he had to give the pot 3 kisses to stop it.
Eventually, Strega Nona came back and stopped the pasta from coming out.
But Big Anthony had to eat around 5 tons of spaghetti, and you could guess what happened.
So the tool is to follow directions, and don’t be a Big Anthony, I repeat Don’t Be A Big Anthony!
Next up is 3rd grade.
3rd grade has a very big event, Ellis Island.
Ellis Island is when you go into the M.P.R. and dress up and pretend you are a different person.
The person you pretend to be is an immigrant from another country.
You have to get through security, not be sick, and you can buy things.
You can also write letters to your family back in your old country.
That gave me an important tool, to be thankful for where I live, and that I am lucky to be born into the family I have, and not live in someone else’s shoes.
Now we will talk about 4th grade.
Probably the biggest thing you do in 4th grade is the 4th Grade Fiesta.
In the 4th Grade Fiesta, you sing songs, dance, and eat Mexican food(Yummy Yummy)!
Most 4th graders would probably agree that they did not like the dancing.
I definitely did not either.
The tool I got from that is that even if you don’t like something, endure through it and you will get rewards(Ex. The end of the line is 5th grade).
Most kids would probably talk about Outdoor Ed, but I don’t really get what tool you would get from that.
Surviving in the wild?
Learning about the outdoors?
I will talk about the State Report instead.
In this report, you have to learn about a state, write interesting facts on a trifold poster, and memorize a speech you made.
It is hard work to glue everything onto the trifold, find the facts, make it look nice, and create and memorize a 3 minute speech.
But if you put a lot of work into it, it will look amazing.
That is a good tool.
Finish everything first, and then you have time to do what you want.
Thank you siblings and parents and aunts and uncles and grandparents or whatever relationship you are to your culminating 5th graders, for coming out, changing your schedules, working around your everyday lives, and thank you teachers for helping us get the tools to build a bridge to middle school, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
5th graders, yay!
We’re culminating!
The bear who lived in the forest heard a loud and strange call.
Who could it be, he thought to himself.
He realized it was the Jade Emperor.
Calling to all the animals in the forest.
The year has shifted in an unknown way, and the Zodiac is ruined.
We will have to do it again, or else there will be no time.
We will add a new animal, the Bear.
The bear celebrated that he was chosen.
He was the special one.
The next day, the bear arrived at the starting line.
The ice on the ground shined like the stars.
You could feel the cold breeze.
You could see the bear zoom off at the start.
The race had begun.
Suddenly, the horse caught up with the bear, and the bear attacked the horse.
Nobody passes me, the bear howled at the fallen horse.
The bear was as vicious as a black widow.
Yelled the horse.
A little farther back, the ox saw the fallen horse, and helped him up.
He asked who did it, and the horse said the bear.
The ox sprinted up to the newly formed zodiac, and said, Not cool.
I am stopping you.
The bear rammed into him, and that is when everything changed.
Why did you bite me?
If that’s what you want to do, here is a taste of your medicine, The bear bit into the ox’s leg, and blood poured out like water from a river, and the bear’s teeth, like razors, pierced the poor ox.
As the raven once quoted, the bear said, Nevermore.
You will not pass me now.
As the bear gracefully swam through the dangerous river, and sprinted toward the finish line, a flash appeared in front of him.
Blending in with his brown fur, the rat jumped off the bear’s back, and beat him with the same trick used on the ox that was now bleeding, thousands of years ago.
With all the viciousness of the bear, and the insanity of the race, the bear was tricked at the end,.
He was announced as 2nd place.
To fit in, wear the same clothes that the other girls are wearing.
Hang out with girls, and go play hopscotch.
You should not hang out with the boys and run around.
Native Americans use natural resources in their everyday lives.
My chosen tribe was the Apache, who live in the Southwest USA.
Today, the Apache would live in Arizona and New Mexico, which are very warm.
In this report, you will learn about the Apache’s traditions, food, tools, clothing, shelter, and 3 facts.
Natural resources are very important for Apache food.
Food is necessary for survival, and they get it through hunting and gathering.
One way the Apache get food is by hunting.
Buffalo is one animal they hunt.
People also hunt other animals though.
The Apache also gather acorns and berries, which are very important staples.
They can cook inside their wikiups and their tepees.
The Apache made great use of their food resources.
The Apache built their homes using natural materials.
One type of home was a wikiup.
A wikiup was also known as a wigwam.
The wikiup had a dome shape.
Another type of home was a tepee.
A tepee was a temporary structure.
A tepee was also lightweight.
The Apache were nomads, which means they had no permanent home, and nomads usually traveled in search of food.
That is how they used natural resources to build homes, why they were nomads, and what their homes were like.
The Apache also used natural resources to make clothing and artifacts.
Apache clothing was sometimes made of leather.
The shoes the Apache wore were called moccasins.
Tools were very helpful in Apache life.
One tool they used was a travois, which was used by nomads.
They also used horses, which were important because they helped with transportation.
The weapons they used included arrowheads and a bow and arrow.
These tools were important for everyday life, hunting, and travel.
My tribe had many interesting customs, traditions, and artifacts.
One tradition they had was eating roasted agave.
Agave comes from cacti.
Agave was a food they enjoyed a lot.
Apache women stayed at home.
They made artifacts.
One type of artifact was sewn baskets.
The men were warriors.
Finally, the extended family stayed together.
These facts make the Apache interesting to learn about.
I am about to share 3 interesting facts about the Apache.
When an Apache woman marries a man, the man joins the woman’s family.
Also, the Apache word for corn is maize.
Finally, a famous Apache was Geronimo.
The Apache had unique customs and facts about them.
All Native American tribes use the natural resources around them in their everyday lives.
The Apache used natural resources in many ways, have an interesting culture, and live interesting lives.
There are many things to learn about the Apache.
They are a special tribe with strong characteristics.
You hear the bell ringing.
You just got out of school.
It is a cold winter day, and you hear the pitter patter of rain outside.
When you get home, you want to play your new FIFA game, and drink hot chocolate.
You sit on the couch, and right before the Xbox turns on, you realize you have two hours of homework.
You just spent an hour learning something in class, and chances are you will remember it.
How could you possibly forget it?
Homework eats up free time that could be spent with family, wastes time, and cuts into sleep because kids stay up late doing it.
It also raises stress levels for students.
Homework should be banned.
It seems strange that after learning something for an hour, schools expect students to forget it, and so they assign homework to “remember” it.
According to apa.org, homework barely makes a difference.
Test scores don’t improve much with or without homework (APA).
This means someone could spend hours on homework to maybe get a 96% on a test, when doing no homework might get them a 95.
It’s not a few minutes of homework, it’s a huge amount.
A PBS writer said the average student spends 81 minutes on nightly homework.
That’s 1 hour and 21 minutes.
John Buell from the Huffington Post explained that some research even shows homework can make grades worse (Buell).
One hour and twenty-one minutes is a massive chunk of time.
Someone could be spending that time with family instead.
If you multiply that over 180 school days, it’s 180 x 81 minutes, which equals 14,580 minutes, or 243 hours.
243 hours could be spent with family.
In 2017, everyone is so busy that homework takes up almost all free time.
It’s a lot of work without making a real difference.
An extra hour of homework might only earn one more question correct.
Homework wastes time, both personal and family time.
Scholastic pointed out that homework steals family time just to meet arbitrary school rules, not because it’s truly needed for learning.
This means free time is grabbed by homework.
Time is scarce, and homework eats it all.
Kristen Weir from the New York Times said homework takes up a lot of time, and that increasing amounts of it can negatively affect grades.
Peter Drucker from the Huffington Post called homework a waste of time, arguing students could use their time better.
Homework often doesn’t help grades, and sometimes it makes them worse.
Most people know how stressful it is.
Studies show homework stresses students more than no homework does.
John Buell from Alternet said if homework were a prescription drug, the FDA would have banned it because it is so unhealthy.
The Huffington Post wrote that too much schoolwork and homework causes stress and anxiety.
Stress comes from teachers giving too much homework.
Some argue homework teaches time management, independence, and helps schoolwork (e-skool), but studies show homework has mostly negative effects.
Few positives, massive negatives.
It steals free time.
Memphis Parent wrote that students might learn time management, but they don’t get enough time overall.
Those claiming homework is amazing are often organizations like Common Core or companies making standardized tests.
It’s like the CEO of McDonald’s saying fast food is healthy—just promoting profit.
Evidence shows homework is largely useless.
It wastes free time, isn’t necessary, and stresses students.
That’s why homework should be eliminated.
It’s an unnecessary form of torture that causes discomfort.
Without homework, life would be better.
Greetings, Hello, nice to meet you.
My name is Walle.
I am from Timbuktu and I am 49 years old.
If you don’t know, Timbuktu was the capital of Mansa Musa’s Mali Kingdom.
I am a brewer; I make beer and create drinks for people.
It’s very enjoyable.
I taught myself to be a brewer after retiring from being a ferba because it sounded more fun.
I live in the brewery, which is pretty big.
When I am not working, I love to cook.
I mostly eat salted meat and vegetables.
I also pray to Allah, as I am Muslim.
In my society, men and women have mostly equal rights.
Our ruler, Mansa Musa, has complete power and is currently the wealthiest man alive.
The Hajj is an important event, and I went on it with Mansa Musa.
I met Mansa Musa when I was a government official, but fifteen years ago I switched to brewing.
He treated me well except for the time I overslept, which made him very angry.
Thanks for reading my letter.
I hope you learned something about my culture.
Hope to see you at the Faire.
Sincerely, Walle.
In Counting by 7s, the character who changes the most is Dell Duke, the counselor who doesn’t do his job.
At the start, Dell didn’t run because he wasn’t in shape, had no desire, and was a slob who didn’t appreciate the world.
By the end, Dell runs and gets in shape.
When he met Willow, he was unathletic and uninspired.
He didn’t need to run because he had no desire to change.
Dell also didn’t know how to pace himself when running.
He might sprint five seconds and get tired fast.
When he ran for fourteen minutes, he looked like he might pass out and probably didn’t run a full mile.
Next, Dell was lazy and ate only microwavable meatloaf.
He had no real furniture and just used plastic chairs.
He saw nobody, so he didn’t care about appearances.
When Pattie Nguyen opened the closet, they saw a tower of unwashed boxers.
He only ate meatloaf because he could.
Nobody watched him, so he ate whatever he wanted.
Lastly, he didn’t appreciate the world, just laying around and ignoring others.
When he met Willow, and her parents died, he began to see the world differently.
He left Cheddar at the start of the book, but at the end, he rescued him.
Dell became a much different man.
He isn’t a slob anymore because of the Nguyens, and is healthier, no longer eating just meatloaf.
He also sees the world differently.
He would have remained a slob without Willow, but he changed.
I wore a fancy outfit.
My parents told me to.
I wanted a Neff shirt and athletic pants.
Why?
I wanted to make a good impression, and I liked the shirt.
My parents said I had to “look good” on the first day of middle school.
But really, my outfit would have looked fine.
Willow didn’t cheat for several reasons.
She probably didn’t know about the test, or any sources.
To test if she cheats, give her a new random test.
If she scores 100 on a new test, she didn’t cheat.
If below 70%, then maybe she did.
Describe a topic or concept you find so fascinating it makes you lose track of time.
Why does it captivate you?
Who or what do you turn to when learning more?
August 21, 2019, 11:15 a.m.: I stepped into Spanish 1 for the first time.
Like my friends, I wasn’t excited at first.
Later, I realized I really enjoyed Spanish and learning how languages are structured.
I started participating more than my peers.
I read extra material and watched Spanish shows to expand vocabulary.
Even during Covid-19, I made progress and my passion continues.
I plan to study Spanish and other languages in college and beyond.
I joined language learning forums and had interesting conversations with native speakers.
Studying languages inspires me; I hope to become a polyglot.
Localization—adapting content for another audience—is something I want to explore.
I am not yet proficient enough to localize, but I have read and watched materials on it.
I find it fascinating to translate jokes and puns, like antelopes eating cantaloupes.
I’ve spent hundreds of hours reading linguistics and studying grammar.
A few years ago, I thought languages were just English with different words.
Learning Finnish challenged me with its 15 grammatical cases.
I haven’t mastered it yet, but I’m proud of my progress.
Though some think high school language classes are boring, I enjoyed them and am thrilled to be in Spanish 4 Honors.
Language learning has helped me connect with people and sparked a love of learning beyond Spanish class.
Change is slow, but extreme events can force immediate change.
In 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Pierre Aronnax and his crew are taken hostage.
Aronnax is a famous explorer, and Nemo wants his expertise.
They are thrown overboard and trapped on the Nautilus.
At first, Aronnax is intrigued, but horror sets in when he realizes he can’t leave.
Aronnax begins eager and adventurous but ends repulsed by the Nautilus.
Trauma shifts his perspective from excitement to fear.
He is invited on the Abraham Lincoln to hunt a sea monster.
He and his companions, Conseil and Ned Land, attempt to stop it but fail.
They jump overboard and land on a submarine.
Still excited at first, Aronnax tries to reason with Nemo in multiple languages.
They learn they will travel but never leave the Nautilus.
Aronnax is fascinated by the ship’s organ, equipment, and library.
He and his companions are explorers, so this excites them.
Repeated trauma changes even the strongest perspectives.
Nemo takes them to the South Pole, where they become trapped by an iceberg.
Limited food, water, and air create extreme stress.
Aronnax experiences pain and wants to escape.
Other dangerous events continue, like the giant squid, which kills a crewmate.
These traumas erode Aronnax’s desire to explore.
Each near-death experience makes him want to leave the Nautilus.
The final event is a massive whirlpool, frightening everyone.
Nemo panics, plays haunting chords, and shouts.
Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned escape on a dinghy and land on an island.
They are no longer adventurers; stress and trauma have changed them.
Impactful events can rapidly change people.
Aronnax, once ambitious, risks everything to escape.
He rejects exploration after these events.
This mirrors real-life change, like 9/11 impacting security and society.
Generational changes shape humanity, just as events shape individuals.
Luke Skywalker accepts responsibility when R2D2 runs away.
He also accepts responsibility after his family dies, becoming a Jedi.
He saves Princess Leia, knowing it’s his duty.
Luke finds self-motivation by returning to Obi-Wan and wanting to become a Jedi.
He could have given up, but he persevered.
Han Solo demonstrates self-management, knowing what to do and when.
His skill helps him survive dangerous situations like with Greedo and the Death Star.
Luke, Han, and Chewbacca show interdependence when they work together to reach the control room.
Without teamwork, they wouldn’t succeed.
Another example of interdependence occurs when Chewy, Luke, and Han work together to rescue the princess by pretending that Chewy is their captive and that they are taking him to a cell.
Coincidentally, that cell happens to be the princess’s, and they help her escape.
Han Solo demonstrates emotional intelligence when he remains unfazed by Greedo pointing a gun at him and demanding money he doesn’t have.
He shows remarkable control over his emotions, remaining calm under stress.
Even when stormtroopers attack, he does not panic.
Instead, he boards the Millennium Falcon and instructs Chewbacca to fly them out of Mos Eisley.
Luke Skywalker shows self-belief when Obi-Wan places a helmet over his head and he must defend himself against a blaster ball with a lightsaber.
Had he doubted himself, he would have been struck.
Instead, he trusts both himself and the Force, allowing him to act confidently.
After R2D2 and C3PO exit the escape pod, C3PO resists following R2D2, claiming he is choosing the wrong path.
Eventually, C3PO ends up in a less optimal location and blames R2D2, despite it being C3PO’s own failure to listen.
Ever wondered about black holes?
Of course you have!
They are one of the most intriguing topics in space for non-astronomers.
The fact that they remain theoretical only increases the curiosity.
Now, there is speculation not just about black holes, but their theoretical opposites.
White holes are considered the counterparts to black holes.
Like black holes, approaching a white hole would warp spacetime.
The force of a white hole is so intense that anything nearby could be destroyed.
White holes are theorized to form from the rotation of black holes.
If a white hole connects to a black hole, it could create a wormhole.
Though theoretical, the idea of white holes has existed for over fifty years.
In 1964, Russian cosmologist Igor Novikov proposed the concept as part of a solution to Einstein’s field equations, specifically for an eternal, non-rotating, uncharged black hole (White Holes Wikipedia).
To explore this concept further, Brit Bendavid and Jacob Rosen of Space Corp. are producing a documentary on white holes.
The short documentary is in pre-production and slated for release on Friday, April 28, 2017.
Although it will be a direct-to-video release, it can still be watched at home.
It will not appear in IMAX, but copies will be sold by Space Corp.
Their address is 29276 Circle Drive, Malibou Lake, California, 91301.
Copies can also be ordered by phone at (278) 766-6691.
The cost is $19.99 or a three-day rental for $4.
Two central questions drive the book: who the ghost is and who killed King Hamlet.
The multiple appearances of the ghost throughout the first act, including its final appearance in the act, highlight this mystery.
Since returning from Wittenberg, I have witnessed remarkable events.
I was first asked to investigate a ghost, which I doubted.
To my amazement, the ghost was real.
Afterward, the state of Denmark became increasingly chaotic.
King Claudius announced he would marry his late brother’s widow, causing turmoil among us Danes.
Poor Hamlet fell into despair, seeing his life as futile, though he later declares he is fine and plans to act in ways that may appear mad.
This period has been the wildest of my life!
Highland climates are found in elevated mountainous regions.
They do not experience traditional seasons.
Any seasonal effects are mostly noticeable at lower elevations.
Mountains have distinct climates because temperature changes with elevation.
At the base, it might be 80 degrees and sunny; higher up, it becomes colder and rainy.
Climbing further, snow and freezing temperatures can appear.
On average, temperature drops about three degrees for every 1,000 feet of elevation.
Precipitation in highlands also varies with altitude.
Some mountains have dry bases while their peaks are snow-covered.
This occurs because high elevations force warm air upward, cooling it and creating precipitation.
Vegetation in highlands changes with elevation.
At the base, plant life mirrors the surrounding region.
On a rainforest mountain, the base would support rainforest species.
Higher elevations support plants adapted to colder climates, eventually giving way to barren areas.
Mountains often feature a tree line, marking the limit of tree growth.
Tree lines vary depending on temperature, soil, and moisture.
Animals in highlands also vary with elevation and surrounding ecosystems.
Mountain goats are common in the Rockies, with feet adapted to steep terrain.
Large cats like mountain lions and snow leopards inhabit these regions.
Snow leopards have broad feet and thick tails for balance in mountainous terrain.
Highland climates range from cool to cold, depending on altitude.
Temperature changes rapidly with elevation.
The highland climate mirrors surrounding biomes but is usually cooler and wetter.
Recycling was once widely practiced, turning waste into new products and benefiting society.
Today, this practice has declined, especially since China stopped importing U.S. trash due to health and economic concerns.
Previously, U.S. ships traveled empty to China, wasting fuel and money.
When China purchased U.S. waste for recycling, it created economic benefits.
Over time, however, China no longer needed the excess plastic, causing more problems than it solved.
The end of U.S.-China recycling has increased landfill waste and environmental harm.
A domestic recycling solution could have mitigated this issue, but dependency on China caused the collapse of green plastic initiatives.
Society’s future depends on finding ways to reuse materials sustainably.
Tax incentives for recycling could encourage the use of eco-friendly plastics.
Change is inevitable, but its direction depends on our choices.
Jem matures throughout the book, evolving from a rebellious boy into a more responsible young man.
Early on, he resists rules and disrespects authority, acting selfishly.
For example, Dill dares Jem to touch the Radley house.
Instead of showing maturity, Jem rushes to the house, slaps it, and runs back.
Despite warnings about Boo Radley, he acts recklessly to impress Dill.
His actions reveal his immaturity, though fortunately, nothing tragic occurs.
Jem changes positively over time.
Change requires external influence.
Jem adapts to his environment, learning right from wrong.
He stands up for what is right, as when confronting Mrs. Dubose’s racist comments about Atticus.
He cuts her hedges to demonstrate that her views are unacceptable (Lee, 135).
This was a reactive decision, driven by his growing sense of justice.
He believes in his father and acts accordingly.
Jem’s attitude reflects his father’s stress during the case, showing environmental influence on behavior.
Many ancient Greek inventions remain in use today, including democracy, coins, and boats.
Greek democracy relied on an assembly voting on laws and leaders.
Today, we vote for Democratic or Republican candidates.
Modern government consists of three branches: Legislative, Judicial, and Executive.
The president and vice president belong to the executive branch.
The legislature (Congress) writes laws, while the judiciary (Supreme Court) interprets them.
Ancient Greek coins included Talent, Mina, and Drachma.
Modern currency includes coins and paper bills in various denominations.
Ancient boats relied on sails and oars, while modern boats use motors or steam engines.
Wooden boats were handcrafted; today’s boats use metal, strong plastics, or alloys.
Ancient boats had small capacities; modern cruise ships feature theaters, pools, restaurants, and suites.
Gravity affects objects even when they are not falling.
Gravity’s strength depends on an object’s mass and the gravitational environment.
Weight is the force of gravity on mass, measured by the compression of a scale.

Doing good differs from doing well; the former prioritizes positive impact, the latter prioritizes profit.
Mattel diversifying Barbie dolls promotes inclusivity and healthier beauty standards.
This topic is better suited for daily coverage than monthly, as its impact is gradual.
Both authors criticize cookie-cutter representations in toys, highlighting potential harm.
Diversifying Barbies mitigates these harms, making dolls accessible to more children.
The tone is serious, reflecting the importance of the issue.
The voice conveys pain and personal struggle.
An omniscient third-person POV could provide similar plausibility but might shift perspective to the oppressors.
Hitchen shows interrogators’ sympathy despite the simulated torture, humanizing them.
Although simulated, participants likely felt real distress.
Hachiya conveys grimace through tone, while Hitchen conveys suffering.
Both use detailed and serious language; Hachiya evokes sadness, Hitchen anger.
Hachiya illustrates racial discrimination, though figurative language risks diminishing credibility.
Addressing his son emphasizes multigenerational, systemic issues.
Mentioning victims highlights the harsh realities African Americans face.
Coates assumes schools are adversarial, but supportive institutions exist.
The educational system is flawed, affecting all students.

Students adapted using digital communication, maintaining some social connection.
Overall, distance learning proved effective despite social limitations.
Sentiment analysis evaluates whether text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
This paper applies a BiRNN to Wikipedia revisions, examining shifts before and after major events.
Political issues experienced sharp negative sentiment shifts.
Online language reflects real-world emotions, amplified by connectivity.
Wikipedia’s frequent updates allow tracking of sentiment changes.
Articles aim for neutrality but often display bias (Greenstein & Zhu, 2012).
Evaluating revisions reveals language trends and reactions to events (Ferron & Massa, 2011; Keegan et al., 2013).
Research questions: extent of sentiment change, universality across topics, and speed of change.
Manual review is infeasible; computational models are required.
A BiRNN trained on Twitter data tracked sentence sentiment over time.
Despite domain differences, qualitative tests showed the model performed adequately on Wikipedia.
Sentiment analysis uses context-aware BiRNNs rather than simple cosine similarity.
Language intake affects perception and sentiment (Mutz et al., 1997).
The dataset contained positive, negative, neutral, and irrelevant tweets; irrelevant samples were removed.
Remaining data: 22,542 negative, 20,832 positive, 18,318 neutral samples.
Sequences were padded at batch time; no additional preprocessing was applied.
The BiRNN had two hidden layers of size 48 per direction and two feedforward layers (128 and 64 features).
Dropout was applied at 0.3 in BiRNN and 0.5 in feedforward layers.
Training used cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer (learning rate 10^-4).
Batches of 32 were trained over 144 epochs, achieving 0.26 training loss and 0.84 F1 score on validation.
Topics analyzed included Charli XCX, Dave Grohl, Russia, Ukraine, Zionism, and apples as a control.
Date ranges were chosen to capture sufficient edits before and after events.
Graphs averaged revisions and mapped data points to the date of the last revision in each batch.
Control (apple) showed stable sentiment, except for short etymology sections.
Russia showed gradual negative sentiment decline in the main contents, and sharp decline in government/politics.
Ukraine showed stable or slightly positive sentiment, except for short sections.
Zionism displayed declines in history and fluctuating beliefs; changes remained stagnant after September 2024.
Dave Grohl’s article remained stable, with minor dips due to formatting.
Charli XCX experienced spikes related to heritage and racism sections.
Significant sentiment changes usually returned to prior levels, except for Ukraine’s main contents and late dips in Zionism.
Political topics experienced the most sentiment shifts, whereas pop culture was less affected.
The BiRNN successfully captured context, though training on Twitter may introduce minor domain mismatch.
Future research could train models directly on Wikipedia data.
Wikipedia remains reliable despite emotional writing, as accuracy and sentiment are distinct.
Political topics tend to have more emotional edits, which Wikipedia moderation generally stabilizes.
Caution is advised when interpreting politically charged content, though overall reliability persists.
Summer is approaching, the weather is pleasant, and you are still eating plain instant ramen.
Here are two simple, tasty recipes you can try.
They are healthy, delicious, and far better than instant ramen.
Recipe 1: Poke Bowls (serves 3)
Norwegian farmed salmon is safe to eat raw due to parasite-free feed and often being flash-frozen.
Recipe 2: Hearty Pasta Salad (serves 6)
Many students eat plain pasta; turning it into a salad adds flavor and nutrition.
With these two recipes, summer becomes more enjoyable and cooking easier.
My artistic perspective emphasizes struggle—adapting to life in the U.S., preserving culture, and resisting oppression.
The acting style for this production should generally be loud and emotionally charged, but at times it should also be restrained.
Themes such as violence and abuse should be represented through a clear power dynamic, with the abuser shown as strong and dominating, and the abused as small and powerless.
A good example of this is when the two men grab the young girl.
During this moment, lighting should cast shadows that make the men appear larger than life, while the girl struggles and screams without full strength, symbolizing her lack of power.
This method of expressing struggle through contrast can be applied throughout the production.
For instance, the background can reflect Medea’s difficulty assimilating into American culture, with American elements of a Victorian household looking neglected and dull, while Mexican elements are colorful and vibrant, representing her perspective on life in America.
This contrast can also extend to costume design.
For example, when Medea kills Acan, his American clothing can appear faded and dull, with the only color being the blood.
This emphasizes both Medea’s struggle to adapt and the loss of Acan.
The contrast can be mirrored in the music as well, with lively, uptempo Mexican music playing when Medea speaks, switching to slow, somber American music when Acan speaks.
Overall, my artistic vision emphasizes struggle through contrast in acting, set design, costumes, and music.
The production should be accessible to a wide audience, but its message is particularly timely.
In the current climate of hostility toward immigrants, it is important to show the significance of maintaining cultural identity, assimilating, and accepting both.
This tension drives the play, and in a time of growing intolerance, the production serves as a reminder of the importance of empathy and acceptance.
I want the audience to understand the consequences of a lack of kindness and understanding.
The tragedy of this play, including the deaths of characters like Acan and Armida, illustrates the harm caused by cruelty and indifference.
Many people today fail to treat others with empathy, and the production should reflect the outcomes of such behavior.
I hope the audience leaves feeling compassion for the characters, particularly those who suffered or died.
This emphasis on kindness and understanding directly reinforces the theme of struggle, showing what happens when characters are deprived of it.
Armida, though morally complex, is still a victim, as is Acan, whose death highlights the consequences of approaching cultural conflict without compassion.
My central visual motif is the border between the United States and Mexico.
This symbolizes both the cultural transition in Medea’s life and the trauma of crossing the border.
I chose this image because I am fascinated by man-made structures and their psychological impact on people.
The motif extends to costume design, with those affected by the harsh border crossing, like Medea, wearing dusty, worn clothing.
Lighting should be bright to reflect the full daylight at the border, but shadows should fall over characters experiencing hardship.
This reinforces the artistic goal of emphasizing struggle and contrasting the experiences of different characters.
The border scene can be directly represented in the set, showing its immense scale and highlighting the difficulty of combining Mexican and American identities for Medea.
Sound design should support this contrast, reducing urban background noise during moments of conflict to evoke the quiet tension of the border.
In these moments, natural sounds such as wind or birds can underscore both the physical and emotional atmosphere.
These design choices highlight differences between characters, illustrating how these differences cause struggle and reinforcing the broader theme of contrast.
I plan to use design elements to construct sets that accentuate differences and conflict.
Lighting will enhance contrast between bright and dark areas, and characters in conflict will be positioned to visually emphasize the power dynamic, such as elevating the stronger character.
Line can guide positioning and create symbolic backdrops, like the uneven lines of a border fence, reflecting disorder in the characters’ lives.
Shape will be used in shadows and props to control visual focus.
Form will emphasize three-dimensional objects in the foreground, drawing attention to important elements.
Value, contrast, and color will be employed boldly, with vibrant, lively elements contrasting with dark, muted ones to represent struggle.
Texture will primarily appear in costumes, showing worn or battered clothing for those enduring hardship.
Scale and proportion will visually diminish characters facing oppression, placing them lower or further from the audience.
Motion will reinforce contrast, with constant movement during active scenes and stillness during quieter moments.
Emphasis will be achieved through form and lighting.
Balance will intentionally be uneven, particularly in conflict scenes.
Rhythm will be irregular to illustrate chaos in the characters’ lives.
Space will prioritize important elements closer to the audience and less important elements further away.
Unity will maintain slight chaos, escalating during conflict.
Most production decisions align with my script analysis.
The primary adjustment I plan to make involves spacing, as intense movement and close proximity between characters in conflict may complicate choreography.
I may reduce emphasis on motion and highlight other contrasts instead.
Over the past few years, the Jewish community has experienced both challenges and growth.
One positive development is the creation of the student-led Jewish magazine, Fig and Vine.
Many community members contributed excellent articles this year.
One contributor, Shani Levy-Richards, graduated this year.
I interviewed her to share her experiences with the community.
I asked Shani how she felt being a Jewish student at UCSB.
She said she enjoyed it, largely due to the size of the Jewish community.
UCSB has the largest Jewish community among UC schools, creating a strong and active community.
She also appreciated the various events hosted by Hillel and Chabad.
These events were engaging, fun, and helped her meet friends.
Some of her favorite memories included Pesach at Hillel and other Chabad events.
She said UCSB’s community felt more welcoming than other UC campuses.
I asked her why she joined Fig and Vine.
She said her interest in Jewish history drew her to contribute.
She enjoys exploring Jewish history, as there is so much to learn and document.
She compared writing for Fig and Vine to keeping a diary.
Shani feels more confident expressing herself in writing than in speaking.
Writing empowers her, unlike traditional homework.
I asked about her post-college plans.
She plans to take a gap year before pursuing a master’s in English or history.
Although she has left UCSB, her twin sister remains, so she plans to visit.
I asked how the Jewish community has evolved at UCSB.
She noted that events such as October 7th and rising antisemitism have strengthened the community.
The community has grown tighter to survive challenges.
She wished everyone good luck and thanked the community.
Shani has contributed significantly and will be missed.
We hope she enjoys graduate school and returns to Santa Barbara soon.
Throughout history, many indigenous groups have faced government oppression.
When oppressed, these communities sometimes rebel, occasionally gaining independence.
The Zapatistas in Chiapas, Mexico, are an example.
They faced diminished land rights and racist policies.
These injustices led them to revolt on the day NAFTA was signed.
They briefly occupied six towns before retreating to the jungle.
The Mexican government responded with military force, violence, and massacres.
The government sought to appear strong and capable internationally.
Despite peace efforts, the underlying issues remain unresolved.
The Zapatistas demand free elections, recognition as a belligerent force, an end to neoliberal policies, and general elections for Chiapas.
Their demands stem from historical abuses by the Spanish and Mexican governments.
Indigenous communities in Chiapas have been excluded from government decision-making and basic services.
Land seizures were often disguised as dispute resolutions between groups.
These injustices fueled the Zapatista rebellion.
The conflict escalated on January 1, 1994, when Mexico joined NAFTA.
The Mexican government sought global approval, while the Zapatistas demanded independence.
The rebellion continues today due to unmet demands.
The conflict illustrates the consequences of government oppression.
Similar struggles exist worldwide, including Guatemala and the United States.
Indigenous groups often fight for their rights over land, water, and resources.
Persistence in resistance has historically led to positive outcomes, even if delayed.
The Zapatista situation exemplifies the ongoing need to respect and address indigenous rights.
Rabbinic literature differs from the Hebrew Bible in several ways.
Revelation in the Hebrew Bible occurred through prophets, while in Rabbinic literature, it is transmitted through study and interpretation.
Two key features are makhloket and safek.
Makhloket refers to disagreements among Rabbis, and safek refers to uncertainty.
The emergence of Torah scholars enabled interpretation, not just understanding.
The Hebrew Bible’s vagueness often caused disagreements in interpretation.
The Tannaim and Amoraim had different approaches to Torah scholars.
Tannaim emphasized understanding the Torah, while Amoraim emphasized debate and interpretation.
Tannaim viewed Torah study as secondary to a job, while Amoraim treated it as a profession.
Examples include gathering manna and the story of Rav Shimon Bar Yochai.
The Tannaim said manna should be gathered daily, while the Amoraim allowed preparation for Shabbat.
Rav Shimon Bar Yochai valued Torah knowledge over physical health.
Makhloket preserves minority opinions for future legal flexibility.
Modern examples include the Supreme Court’s treatment of minority opinions.
Jewish law evolved significantly over time.
Initially, it was a teaching tool, then became strict and statutory during the Second Temple period.
Sectarian divisions emerged, such as the Pharisees and Sadducees.
After the Second Temple, Rabbinic interpretation allowed flexibility.
The Mishnah and Gemara preserved multiple views to guide future courts.
The evolution of law reflects a shift from pedagogy to strict statute, and finally to interpretive flexibility.
Multiple perspectives are often valid, showing that life is not strictly black and white.
Journal 5: I think that blood quantum are a very important topic to be discussed.
I did this journal entry before we watch the video about the Indigenous people in Canada, and how they were not treated as a part of their community, and I believe that that is horrible, and the culture that you grow up in determines your ethnicity and what community you belong to, not your genetics.
Additionally, oftentimes these blood quantum are only a problem for women who intermarry rather than men, not just making society more xenophobic but also more misogynistic.
Overall this is an important issue that I hope more people will start to discuss.
Journal 6: I think assuming that western education, and the systems that surround and govern it are the default and nest way to educate is a very dangerous assumption to make, and a myth that needs to be distilled.
For example, Finland has some of the highest test scores in the world, and they spend significantly less time learning.
Additionally, many forms of western education are competitive rather than collaborative, which can lead to heightened anxiety and an overall worse outcome for science as compared to those who are not stressed.
It is important that these myths get distilled, and that we all learn the truth.
Journal 7: This journal was speaking about how certain indigenous communities in Latin America have been fighting for their rights, in regards specifically to their culture.
This is a very important part of learning about how indigenous people get affected by the state — indigenous people are not idle ducks — they will fight a gains unfair laws and orders put upon them.
It is very important to remember that learning about these fights against tyrannical laws are just as important as learning about the tyrannical laws themselves — having information about both helps us better understand the context of ever indigenous struggle in the world.
Journal 8: I really enjoyed this talk — I am a very big dan of music (I have been playing piano since age 5, I love listening to music and making music), so I can appreciate the importance of music to both individuals and to a larger culture.
I enjoyed learning about all the ways that the indigenous communities in Oaxaca preserved their culture, but the music part specifically stood out to me for the aforementioned reason.
Overall, my main takeaway from this week’s journal entry is that there are many important facets to one’s culture, and finding ways to preserve them is very important (such as with the music).
Journal 9: I really resonated with this journal entry because I really care about nature and I do my best to be in harmony with it.
I love going on hikes with my friends, and loving nature for what it is and has to offer shows me that the oftentimes overly urbanized capitalist society does not appreciate where we came from.
I always do my best to keep nature clean and safe — there only is one Earth upon which we live, and taking care of it is very important.
That being said, the Earth (as discussed in the reading) can benefit sometimes from being taken from, so it is important to be a part of the planet and to love the planet.
Journal 10: I believe that state intervention is a major problem when it comes to indigenous issues.
Although this is not necessarily about indigenous rights, what has been currently going on with ICE and the Trump administration is a good demonstration about the problems with state intervention.
By the state not listening to the demands of the protestors and instead sending in the ICE and making the situation more dangerous for everybody, they end up aggravating people and showing people that this aforementioned kind of intervention (rather than listening) is a major problem in our society today, in regards to the state.
AbstractIntroduction.
Patient evaluation and diagnosis is important in cases of aphasia to provide good treatment and support.
A YouTube video of an aphasic is watched and a diagnosis is provided from said video.
A transcription was made for the video, and it was found that the patient had difficulty forming long sentences, and oftentimes fell back on familiar language.
It was determined that the patient in question has Broca’s Aphasia.
Correctly diagnosing and treating Aphasias is important to help the patient, and give closure to them and their family.
Learning about aphasias and the type of symptoms that they produce is important as it can help patients receive the care they need, and help those around them understand what is happening and why.
Additionally, since aphasics can get better over time, it is important to diagnose it so that they be in an environment conducive to brain recovery, such as language rehabilitation.
While many people might rush to diagnose the aphasia quickly, getting language rehabilitation at any point will help about the same amount (Moss & Nicholas, 2006).
One of the major types of aphasia, Broca’s Aphasia, is caused by damage in BA 44 and 45 and patients often have issues with speaking fluently, finding the correct words, articulating well, repetition, and the production of complex sentences (Dronkers etal, 2007).
Because other language tasks, such as semantics, and comprehension, occur in other parts of the brain, even though they are closely intertwined with tasks associated with Broca’s Aphasia, they are not affected in Broca’s Aphasics (Schwartz etal, 2009).
Case StudyThe person being discussed is an elderly woman, Jan, who is having a discussion with her daughter, Carly, on a YouTube channel they share dedicated to informing people about aphasia.
The specific video is about how to have a good conversation with an aphasiac.
ResultsWithin the conversation, she had difficulty creating complex sentences, and saying the name of a number (although she could write it down).
Additionally, her daughter (who also is her caretaker) already had a sheet on hand with many activities on it, further indicating that she had problems expressing her thoughts.
Jan additionally had multiple phonemic paraphasias.
Patient also extensively used the word yeah, as this was the only interjection used by Jan (at least during this recorded snippet).
Additionally, almost every utterance she said was very short, lending to the fact that it was difficult for her to form long utterances.
DiagnosisBecause Jan’s speech was at times telegraphic, and she had word finding difficulty, the diagnosis that is given is Broca’s Aphasia.
Jan showed a high level of comprehension (ruling out Wernicke’s Aphasia and Global Aphasia).
There were also many signs of Broca’s Aphasia, such as a common word or phase being often used (in this case yeah), and the knowledge of a number, but not being able to say the name of it.
DiscussionAs previously discussed, the diagnosis and understanding of diseases like Broca’s Aphasia are important as they can help get patients the best treatment that they deserve and give closure to both them and those close to the patients.
Since certain aphasias are caused by certain areas of the brain (Schwartz etal, 2009), being able to know what is and what is not affected for patients like Jan is essential because treating her like a Wernicke’s Aphasiac will not help her in any meaningful way, and would be mentally taxing for her.
Giving her the correct treatment could, as previously discussed, bring back language functionality to her brain (Moss & Nicholas, 2006), further stressing the importance of correctly identifying and treating aphasias.
Additionally, knowing a rough idea of the area in the brain in which the the stroke occurred is helpful because it can predict other symptoms of the stroke.
Since Broca’s area is near BA 44 and 45 (Dronkers etal, 2007), other related processes that occur in the frontal lobe nearby will likely be affected.
Overall, correctly diagnosing and treating aphasias is vital to the efficacy of short term care of patients, the potentiality of long term restoration of language skills, and the closure that the patient and their family deserves.
Judaism and food have a long and complex relationship — we have entire holidays dedicated to abstaining from eating.
We have certain foods we can’t eat, and certain foods we must eat.
And finally, lets not forget, gefilte fish.
Jewish culinary culture is formed by these very laws, making Kashrut (kosher laws) an important facet of our food and our culture.
Growing up, I kept no form of kosher, and up to going to school here, I continued this trend.
If you were to ask me what my all time favorite food was, I would have enthusiastically said shrimp!
Having come to college, I formed a deep connection with my Judaism, and in turn, with Kashrut.
While I might not be fully orthodox kosher (I will still eat at non-kosher restaurants as a pescatarian with a shellfish allergy), I do keep a somewhat strict degree of Kashrut.
I may be a Jew in IV who keeps kosher, but I am not the only Jew in IV that does, so I wanted to see what others’ experiences with Kashrut in IV and at UCSB were.
The first person to whom I posed the question of Kashrut in IV was Nicole Zar.
She told me that she grew up keeping kosher, and that this was important to her, so she kept keeping kosher in college.
To her, it is totally doable to keep kosher here, despite the many obstacles.
She said that she often relies on Chabad for meals (especially on Shabbat).
Although it is not simple, she told me, it is a very rewarding part of Judaism that [she] takes pride in and a mitzvah that [she] enjoys keeping!
As Nicole said, UCSB Chabad besides being a keystone to the Jewish community is also one of the best sources of Kosher food in Isla Vista.
Miri Klein, the Rebbetzin at UCSB Chabad, is the mastermind behind all that is food at UCSB Chabad and works tirelessly to ensure that Jewish mouths in IV are fed.
She told me that the biggest challenge for providing so many people food is that there are many difficulties getting large quantities of food — either the foods need to be bought from a kosher market, or comes in very small quantities.
She suggests that anyone who wants to start keeping kosher contact her with any questions, and go to Trader Joes.
I was able to get another perspective from Jake Nguyen, another student who keeps Kosher.
He said that personally, he has not had to make any concessions with Kashrut when coming here, and that the only downside to a kosher diet is that it is more expensive.
All of his friends are also supportive of his diet, making the social aspect of living in IV easy.
He also recommends Trader Joes to anybody who wants to keep kosher, as it is the only place nearby with kosher meat.
Like for Jake, Trader Joes is also an important part of keeping kosher in IV.
Most of the groceries I buy are produce (which don’t require kosher certification), meat, fish, bread (which is more expensive), rice, and pasta.
Thankfully (besides produce), Trader Joes has all of this, so if anybody reading this wants to keep kosher, Trader Joes is a great place to start!
Another student, Idan Fierstein, shared his experiences with me.
He grew up in New York City, where there were many kosher restaurants, and now living here is very difficult in that regard (the closest kosher restaurant is over 70 miles away).
As such, he eats out in restaurants (similarly to how I do), but he says that he appreciates kosher meals more than he used to due to the complexities involved with eating kosher in IV.
He hopes that we can get a kosher food cart in IV like they have in SLO.
Eating out kosher style in non-kosher restaurants is something I understand — even if there were kosher restaurants in IV, it would be very hard to stay social especially with how often social plans revolve around a restaurant.
A way I have found to bridge the gap between keeping kosher and staying social is having plans revolve around cooking in my apartment — even though my apartment isn’t kashered, everything I use for cooking is kosher (including hard-to-come-by kosher items like meat and balsamic vinegar), and as of right now, that’s kosher enough for me!
I do try my best to keep kosher, even if I am not following the laws to the dot of how they are in the book.
Others, however, take a more liberal approach to Kashrut.
When asked about his favorite kosher dish to cook, one Max Bloom responded: I’ve gotta go with the cheeseburger.
For those not in the know, cheeseburgers have not been, are not, and will never be kosher, unless you are Max Bloom.
More power to him!
As you can see, keeping Kosher in Isla Vista is no easy feat — the odds are stacked against you, and unless you live exclusively with others that keep kosher, there will be some difficulties.
While not every Jew keeps kosher, those who do feel a strong connection to the food they eat, and are willing to make sacrifices to keep their diet how they wish.
Overall, Kashrut in Isla Vista comes in many colors, shapes, and forms, and is an important part to the Jewish community in IV.
While The 13 Colonies have not legally been colonies for 100s of years, and do not operate the same way they did when they were considered colonies, the effects of colonialism still affect our everyday lives in many ways.
A good example of this is the perception of race.
Within the reading for this week, it is stated that Cherokee identity is socially and politically constructed, stating that much of what and who is considered Cherokee is largely not decided by the Cherokee  (Strum, 2).
These harmful labels affect every ethnic group in America — anybody of European descent is clumped together as white, or anybody of African ancestry is labeled black, even though Africans who migrated here in the past couple of years have completely different culture and struggles than African-Americans whose lineage has been in the United States since the slave trade.
Another example of colonialism has to do with who lives where.
I go to school at UCSB, and although it is a nice institution, 1000 years ago the Euroamericans who constructed this institution did not even know about the land on which this university sits.
This is not exclusive just to UCSB, as according to the textbook, between 1808 and 1835, Cherokees were increasingly confronted with U.
expansion into their territory in the Southeast (Strum, 52).
Both the Chumash people who lived in the land which now holds UCSB, and the land in which the Cherokee people lived is now land owned by wealthy descendants of colonizers, even though in both example the indigenous people were here first.
This is yet another example of how colonialism still affects our lives today.
In conclusion, while the US is not actively expanding its territory, and many colonial practices are illegal (such as slavery), the scars which these activities left on society many years ago are still visible today.
Race labels are oftentimes arbitrary, and don’t reflect the actual experiences of ethnic groups, and yet they are still used today.
Additionally, the land which many of us inhabit belonged to indigenous people for thousands of years before it belonged to us, and yet we are the ones who live there, not the indigenous people who were forcibly removed.
These examples illustrate how the effects of colonization still remain with us today.
My first memory about Indians was from 1st grade, when we were learning about Thanksgiving.
The holiday was introduced to us, and we learned the typical story — Christopher Columbus accidentally discovered North and South America when he tried to get to India by sailing west.
He called the people there Indians (which was the explanation as to why they were called Indians even though they were not from India).
After Europeans learned about these new continents, they wanted to move there.
One of those groups of people from England, the Pilgrims, ended up caught in a storm and it took too long to get to America, and they ended up landing in the wrong place.
By the time they got off the ship, they were all starving, and there was a nice group of Indians there who helped them, and taught them how to keep the land.
They ended up having a great big feast, which is why we celebrate Thanksgiving today.
This narrative went unchallenged until middle school.
We first learned that no, not only was Columbus not the first person to discover the Americas, he wasn’t even the first European to discover the Americas, just the most famous.
Additionally, we were told another important part about him — mainly that he did horrible things to the indigenous people that he encountered.
We also didn’t learn about the fact that both Indigenous people and Indians do not like when Indigenous people are referred to as Indians, and how that diminishes their identity.
Calling them Indians while mentioning that they aren’t actually Indian implies that they are somehow not worthy of having an endonym to refer to them.
Additionally, the story of the first Thanksgiving is a gross misrepresentation of what actually happened.
While the Indigenous people did help the Pilgrims, there was no feast, and the second that the Europeans were able to kick the Indigenous people out in order to colonize the land.
Architecture has been an important part of history, being with the human race ever since the beginning of civilization, and continuing to be an important part of humanity to today.
As society started to progress, architecture started to prioritize form over function; however, recently, this trend has started to reverse.
A prime example of this is Manzanita Village at UCSB, which was designed to house 1100 UCSB students.
(UCSB Campus Housing, 2024).
Being built in 2001, it is relatively recent, and features a minimalistic approach to its housing, using its space to maximize occupants rather than feature complicated designs.
Simple shapes such as rectangles and triangles are used, as these shapes are cheaper and more space efficient than more ornate designs.
In addition, architectural features that provide little to no functionality to the building such as complicated pillars or statues are not used, opting instead to make every architectural piece of Manzanita Village to contribute to the practicality rather than the aesthetics of the site.
Overall, Manzanita Village is a great example of the trend within contemporary architecture to prioritize function over form known as functionalism, saving both money and time for contemporary architectural works.
Manzanita Village’s architectural designs were implemented to maximize space, as having more space per building means that more students can be housed.
Rather than using just wood or steel, Manzanita Village is built out of primarily reinforced concrete, while incorporating wood and steel as a minority material.
Concrete as a material has many advantages, such as low cost, durability, and the ability for the rooms to cool themselves at night (Bell and Rand).
Advantages such as those can help maximize occupancy — for example, a low cost means more buildings can be built, and the rooms being able to cool themselves at night removes the need for air conditioning infrastructure to be build, further maximizing space.
Additionally, the buildings of Manzanita Village are built with several buildings in the shape of a ‘U,’ allowing for three buildings to share a communal lawn, rather than all the buildings sharing a lawn.
